# Grid

Grid is a high-level language using a mix of imperative and functional constructs, with a focus on being easy to read and reason about.

## Goals

- Reducing the amount of boilerplate required for powerful constructs
- Structural typing
- Pattern matching conditionals
- Clear native type truthiness
- Scope-based memory management without explicit ownership or lifetime tracking
- No garbage collector or reference counting, no borrow checking
- No external dependencies for self-hosting compiler
- First-class functions
